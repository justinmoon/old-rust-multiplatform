When working on rust-multiplatform apps like this, ALWAYS use the redux pattern for state: 
- frontend sends an event to rust
- rust processes it
- rust updates state by writing to sqlite and sending a notification of the update to the frontend
- frontend reads state from SQLite. 
- UI reactively re-renders based on new state

Always use this pattern. State is only ever updated in one direction. Never use bi-directional state.
